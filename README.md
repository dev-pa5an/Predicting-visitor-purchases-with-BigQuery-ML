# Predicting-visitor-purchases-with-BigQuery-ML
This project aims to leverage BigQuery and its Machine Learning capabilities to predict the likelihood of a website visitor making a purchase. By analyzing a public e-commerce dataset within BigQuery, we will build a classification model using logistic regression to identify patterns and features associated with customer conversions.

# Explore ecommerce dataset

```sql
WITH visitors AS(
SELECT
COUNT(DISTINCT fullVisitorId) AS total_visitors
FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
),

purchasers AS(
SELECT
COUNT(DISTINCT fullVisitorId) AS total_purchasers
FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
WHERE totals.transactions IS NOT NULL
)

SELECT
  total_visitors,
  total_purchasers,
  total_purchasers / total_visitors AS conversion_rate
FROM visitors, purchasers
```
# Select features and create your training dataset
The features are bounces and time_on_site. The label is will_buy_on_return_visit
